# MoneyTracker

A simple, privacy-focused budgeting and transaction tracking app that runs entirely in your browser. No accounts, no cloud, no tracking.

## Features

- **Import CSV files** from your bank or credit card
- **Categorize transactions** manually or automatically
- **Create categorization rules** to automatically sort similar transactions
- **Track spending** across His/Hers/Pets/Shared/Transfers budget categories
- **Export your data** for backup or migration to another device
- **Dark mode** for comfortable viewing

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click "Import CSV" to upload your bank statement
3. Review the imported transactions
4. Start categorizing!

## Supported CSV Formats

### Format 1 (Standard Bank Export)
```csv
"Date","Transaction","Name","Memo","Amount"
"2025-09-25","DEBIT","APPLE.COM/BILL","Reference","âˆ’12.99"
```

### Format 2 (Alternative Bank Export)
```csv
Account,ChkRef,Debit,Credit,Balance,Date,Description
CheckingAcct,1234,12.99,,,2025-09-25,APPLE.COM/BILL
```

The app automatically detects which format you're using.

## How to Use

### Importing Transactions
1. Download CSV files from your bank or credit card website
2. Click the "Import CSV" button in MoneyTracker
3. Select your CSV file
4. Review the preview and click "Import" to add transactions

### Categorizing Transactions
1. Click on a transaction to open the category dropdown
2. Select a category
3. The transaction is automatically saved

**Tip**: Select multiple transactions and use "Bulk Categorize" to assign them all at once!

### Creating Auto-Categorization Rules
After manually categorizing a transaction, click "Create Rule" to automatically categorize similar transactions in the future.

Rules use partial text matching, so:
- Rule pattern: "APPLE.COM" will match "APPLE.COM/BILL", "APPLE.COM/US", etc.
- Rule pattern: "EVERYDAY" will match "EVERYDAY 30576015M", "EVERYDAY GROCERY", etc.

### Managing Categories
The app comes with basic category groups:
- **His**: Personal expenses
- **Hers**: Personal expenses
- **Pets**: Pet-related expenses
- **Shared**: Joint expenses
- **Transfers**: Account transfers, credit card payments, savings moves (not "real" spending)

You can add custom categories within each group in the Category Manager.

### Exporting Your Data
Click "Export Data" to download a JSON file containing all your transactions, categories, and rules. This file can be imported on another device to migrate your data.
