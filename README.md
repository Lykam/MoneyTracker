## How to Use

### Importing Transactions
1. Download CSV files from your bank or credit card website
2. Click the "Import CSV" button in MoneyTracker
3. Select your CSV file
4. Review the preview and click "Import" to add transactions

### Categorizing Transactions
1. Click on a transaction to open the category dropdown
2. Select a category
3. The transaction is automatically saved

**Tip**: Select multiple transactions and use "Bulk Categorize" to assign them all at once!

### Smart Auto-Categorization
MoneyTracker learns from your categorization patterns and automatically suggests categories for new transactions.

**How it works:**
1. Categorize transactions normally (manually or with rules)
2. The system learns merchant patterns, amounts, and recurring transactions
3. Future similar transactions get automatic suggestions with confidence scores
4. Review and accept/reject suggestions to improve accuracy over time

**Pattern Mining:**
- Click "Mine Patterns" to analyze your transaction history
- The engine identifies merchants, amounts, and recurring patterns
- Builds a learning model that improves with more data

### Creating Manual Categorization Rules
After manually categorizing a transaction, click "Create Rule" to automatically categorize similar transactions in the future.

Rules use partial text matching, so:
- Rule pattern: "APPLE.COM" will match "APPLE.COM/BILL", "APPLE.COM/US", etc.
- Rule pattern: "EVERYDAY" will match "EVERYDAY 30576015M", "EVERYDAY GROCERY", etc.

### Split Transactions
Some purchases include items from multiple categories (e.g., groceries + pet food at Target).

**Creating a split:**
1. Select a transaction
2. Click "Split Transaction"
3. Add categories and percentages (must sum to 100%)
4. Amounts are automatically calculated

**Using templates:**
- Pre-built templates for common stores (Walmart, Target, Amazon, Costco, etc.)
- Save your own custom templates from any split transaction
- Auto-suggested based on merchant name in description

### Viewing the Dashboard
Open `dashboard.html` to see your spending analytics:
- **Spending by Category** - Doughnut chart showing category breakdown
- **Spending Over Time** - Line chart tracking spending trends
- **Top Categories** - Your highest spending categories
- **Summary Statistics** - Total spending, average per transaction, and more

Filter by time period: Last 30/60/90 days, 6 months, year, or all time.

### Managing Categories
The app comes with basic category groups:
- **His**: Personal expenses
- **Hers**: Personal expenses
- **Pets**: Pet-related expenses
- **Shared**: Joint expenses
- **Transfers**: Account transfers, credit card payments, savings moves (not "real" spending)

You can add custom categories within each group in the Category Manager.

### Exporting Your Data
Click "Export Data" to download a JSON file containing all your transactions, categories, and rules. This file can be imported on another device to migrate your data.
